Important : all numbers are big endian.


MBDB
header
  uint8[6]    'mbdb\5\0'

record (variable size)
  string     Domain
  string     Path
  string     LinkTarget          absolute path
  string     DataHash            SHA.1 (some files only)
  string     unknown             always N/A
  uint16     Mode                same as mbdx.Mode
  uint32     unknown             always 0
  uint32     unknown             
  uint32     UserId
  uint32     GroupId             mostly 501 for apps
  uint32     Time1               relative to unix epoch (e.g time_t)
  uint32     Time2               Time1 or Time2 is the former ModificationTime
  uint32     Time3
  uint64     FileLength          always 0 for link or directory
  uint8      Flag                0 if special (link, directory), otherwise unknown
  uint8      PropertyCount       number of properties following
Property is a couple of strings:

  string      name
  string      value               can be a string or a binary content

A string is composed of a uint16 that contains the length in bytes or 0xFFFF (for null or N/A) then the characters, in UTF-8 with canonical decomposition (Unicode normalization form D).
